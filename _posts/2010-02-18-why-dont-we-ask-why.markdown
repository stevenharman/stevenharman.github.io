Have you ever thought about just how much time we software folk spend
focused on the technologies we're using, on implementation minutia,
and on all of the shiny new *solutions* we *should* be using?

[![Question mark](/assets/images/posts/question-mark.jpg){:class="right"}][1]

Now contrast that with how often we stop to think about the **Whys**?

Why are we being asked to solve *fizz-buzz-thing*; do we understand the
motivation and context behind the problem, or are we fixated on how
we'll build the solution? Are we asking why a problem occurred, or are
we merely focused on how we fixed it, this time?

### Why don't we ask "Why?"

Frankly, because we'd rather spend our time in the comfortable arena
of **how** than venture into the sometimes uneasy realm of **why**.

Asking why often forces us to face the truth, and that truth can be
uncomfortable. We need to have the courage to face those truths and
coninue to ask why; we must have the [courage][2] to pop the why stack.

It's only by asking why that we'll gain the understanding, insight,
and context necessary to effectively solve the problems we're faced
with, to grow, and to improve.

So, *why* are you reading this post? :)
