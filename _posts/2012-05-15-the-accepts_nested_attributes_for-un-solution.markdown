Why does Rails' `accepts_nested_attributes_for` approach always feel so darned
*wrong*?

My suspicion is that it feels wrong because it likely is wrong - or at least it
is likely the wrong tool for the job.

### An example

An accounting of a recent ride I took into the `accepts_nested_attributes_for`
merry go round.

> FFFUUU, this is too complicated! There must be an easier, more Rails-y way.
