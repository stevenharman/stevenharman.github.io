A few months back I gave [little talk][1] on the darling <acronym
title="Source Control Management">SCM</acronym> tool of the Open Source
world, [Git][2]. After the conference, the organizers asked for a copy
of the presentation materials I'd used - something I usually find little
value in as the content of a discussion is far more than just the
collateral used.

At any rate, I obliged, sent off a PDF, and have [opened the talk up][3]
for others to use and improve. You can find the source (Keynote
presentation, images, etc.) on GitHub. Fork and modify the talk to your
heart's content. ♡

Oh, and the [PDF is there][4] too.

Enjoy!
