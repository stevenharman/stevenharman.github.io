I’ve created visualizations for Git repositories before – the one tracked a [product from its first commit through launch][gain-new-insights]. And while I still think there is some information and insight to be gleaned from such visualizations, the real reason I like to make them is... I think they're neat.

To celebrate launching the latest incarnation of [VersionOne][versionone], I made another visualization! This one tracks all changes made in our Git repository that occurred between our last major release (in late February) right through the very last commit that made it into the [Spring 2011 release][spring-release].

Wow… that really sounded like a sales pitch, didn’t it? I hate sales pitches!

Enough of that. Enjoy!
