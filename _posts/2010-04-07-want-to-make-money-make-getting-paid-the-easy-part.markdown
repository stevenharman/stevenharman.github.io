At least half a dozen times in the past three days I've been so annoyed
by the payment process for various goods and/or services that I either
didn't purchase the thing, or had a minor meltdown after the whole
ordeal was over.

Why do merchants insist on making it so damned difficult for their
customers to get the goods?

### A few frustrating examples

Ever been to a sporting event where the beer vendor only accept cash,
has no cash-register, and yet insists on charging a partial dollar
amount per unit of booze? $6.65 for a beer. Really? Just call it $7
and make the math easy for everyone. Or have a cash register at each
kiosk. Or, here's a novel idea, start accepting plastic!

Need to renew your vehicle registration? Just do it online! But be
prepared to spend an extra $5 for the *convenience* of, you knowâ€¦
actually giving them the money now rather than sending a check and them
having to pay someone to physically handle the thing.

### Two simple rules for making money

 1. If you're selling something someone wants: **make it easy for them to
give you their money!**
 1. If you're selling something someone does not want: **make them want
it!**
