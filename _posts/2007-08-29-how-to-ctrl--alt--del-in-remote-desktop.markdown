I’m a fan of [Microsoft’s Remote Desktop][rdp]; it’s built into Windows and allows me to quickly and easily administer a remote box from the comfort of my own work station.
I use it at my house to administer the headless servers on my home network, the [Subtext][subtext] build server, and the co-located [VelocIT][veloc-it] servers.

### Gotta’ love that magic!

Today a [co-worker][micah] asked me how to send the infamous `Control + Alt + Delete` keystroke combination to a machine he was working on via <abbr title="Remote Display (or Desktop) Protocol">RDP</abbr>.
This is a pretty common keystroke to use when trying administer windows… it does have uses other than just killing the box.

With [Virtual PC][virtualpc] there is menu item to send the keystrokes on to the virtual box.
Go to the *Action* menu and select the `Ctrl + Alt + Del` option.

### And with Remote Desktop?

Well it’s not quite as obvious. Actually it’s not an obvious solution at all…
It might not even be documented!?

*For the record, since I already knew the answer I decided to be lazy and didn’t bother to search the tubes for any official documentation.*

To send the `Ctrl + Alt + Del` keystroke combination via RDP you actually need to use...

`Ctrl + Alt + End`

Hmm... _that_ sure is intuitive!
