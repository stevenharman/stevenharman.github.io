As we strive to build more humane user experiences it is important to
not only consider what data to, or *not to*, show, but also *how* we
present that data.

An example from our recent <a title="VersionOne: Conversations"
href="http://versionone.com/Product/Collaboration.asp"
rel="external">Conversations</a> feature is the date and time at which
portions of a conversation take place.

[![Human-friendly date and time via jquery.timeago](/assets/images/posts/fuzzy-time-thumb.png){:class="img-thumbnail img-thumbnail--center"}](/assets/images/posts/fuzzy-time.png)

Notice the two highlighted areas. The
tooltip shows fully-formatted, and much more precise information, with
the "less than a minute ago" text being a more fuzzy, human-friendly
presentation of the same data.

There is no question that the precise data is valuable, but when it
comes to human users of a system, it may not be the most consumable
form. The full-fidelity information is still available to the user who
cares to engage the application, when he cares to engage it.

Whether its fuzzy dates and time, or using avatars instead of user
names, or any number of other examples, the point is to *think* about
the human experience when designing for, well, humans.
