To rebase, or not to rebase - for me its not really a question. I
generally prefer a clean, linear commit history. Why? Because merge bubbles make
history confusing, noisy, and can break `git bisect`.

Don't believe me? Check out the pretty log to the right. See all
those merge bubbles in there? *Eww!*

<h3>The Why?</h3>

The workflow that caused those merges was as follows:

1. `git pull` (to bring local up to date)
2. *hackity-hack*
3. `git commit`
4. `git pull`
5. `git push`

By default `git pull` will fetch any new commits from the remote, and
then merge any local changes in, resulting in the merge bubbles.

<h3>A better approach</h3>

I typically use the same workflow as above with one tweak.
Rather than `git pull` I use `git pull --rebase`.
The `--rebase` option will fetch the remote commits and rebase your commits on top of the new commits from the remote.
This is the "re-writing" of history folks often talk about.

<h3>Make it better, automatically!</h3>

You can tell git to use rebase, rather than merge, in one of two ways, depending on
your situation.

```shell
# Force all new branches to automatically use rebase
$ git config branch.autosetuprebase always
```

You can add the `--global` switch to have all future branches, in all
repositories on this machine, behave this way.

```shell
# Force existing branches to use rebase.
$ git config branch.*branch-name*.rebase true
```
